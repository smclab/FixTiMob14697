FixTiMob14697
=============

This is a module which, using Obj-C catgories, fixes
[the issue TIMOB-14697][TIMOB-14697] on the Titanium Mobile SDK. This issue has
been biting us for the last years and while we’ve been able to find a simple
workaround, we’ve not been able to provide a minimum viable reproducible test
case for Appcelerator to investigate.

That’s why they closed the issue, and we fixed it with this module.

Use it at your own risk!
